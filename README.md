# Editable-grid

A default svg grid is created when a button is clicked. 
The grid size can be changed by dragging one of its four corners, while the size of a grid cell is respected, therefore the grid border can only be changed by a cell distance.
The whole grid can be moved by dragging when clicked.
Density of the grid (size of a grid cell) can be adjusted by scrolling a mouse wheel.
